		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>This is a project that was thought of and developed for the Meteor Hackathon. </p>
		<p>I tape a lot of movies for my Mom and I like to see and be notified of New shows. (especially premeres). I thought it would be nice to 
		create a site that provides me the information I am looking for, if there is an easy and quick way to create it.</p>
		<p>Meteor was a good environment for this project. Before starting it I only had gone through the 3 to do list examples and reviewed 
		some of the local market one. My background is in enterprise development not web, actually this is just my third web application. I am 
		happy with the result. </p>
		<p>This was a real learning experience for me. Prior to this project (and the tutorials) I had not heard of Meteor. I had never used a router and 
		nor did I have any experience in JSON data files. I used two different data sources for data: <ul>
		<li>http://omdbapi.com/ - a live feed (http call) getting the poster uri</li>
		<li>http://developer.tmsapi.com/ - provides the movie schedule (I downloaded and imported the data with the plan to make it "live"</li>
		</ul>
		One of the important benefits Meteor with mongodb has over tool like firebase, is that it has server side code. The design I have in mind would 
		process the code on the server porting in the movie data from differnt locations mostly at a set time, it does not change often.</p>
